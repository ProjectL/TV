###Xbmc Companion Feature
-----------

Right here is some commentary about the Push to XBMC capability added as a feature to Project L's TV and Remote.

As I sit here with this flawless Android All in One LCD Display in front of me after 2 years of experimenting with
Android dongles, I'm super convinced that every TV, Display, Monitor should be backed by the Android OS.

And now seeing the excitement behind these inexpensive but so powerful hardware being unleashed, it's go that XBMC
will play a major part in this content distribution revolution. I call this TV in front of me the Ms.Boo, aka Ms Bootleg.
where I'm from in the Bronx, growing up bootleggers used to be abound with dvds and cds, and still to this day it's a
thriving source of income and entertainment for main non hollywood types. 

But in this new world, the datastream is the new atom, the new everything. What we have ahead of us is bootlegging
machines,  point and counter-click in an instant, even torrents and the piratebays are way too much work for this wave.
This phase in free consumption of expensively produced entertainment is literally click and play, the latest tv, movie,
etc .

So with Project L also designed for these Android/Linux freebeasts, there's an opportunity to use our technology and
methodologies in conjunction with XBMC. In, the form of making it even more simpler and offering on demand content that
can be subscribed and sent to the Remote app or Text msgâ€™d to users, so that user can click the subscribed content
and watch it on their XBMC Tvs/Boxes without having to search or find or add on add ons.

Just subscribe to content, get notifications of what's new/available on your phone or tablet, click and watch it stream
on XBMC.

What's happening here...How's it all work?

Well, XBMC app installed on an Android system can be can be configured to allow JSON-RPC requests, the Project L TV 
app also on the same android system is programmed to report it's local ip back to the hangout. A Content Producer
wants to share her new movie with her audience who have Project L TVs, simply uploads the content and creates a post
in the remote app which notifies her followers of her new piece of content. Once her followers click the content a
request is sent back to Project L's backend with identifying information of the follower and then from the backend
sent to the appropriate TV for the follower to enjoy.

No more sending to repos, to fumble through links and links, just send whats available direct to the viewer so that she
be notified of what's available and press play at her leisure.
