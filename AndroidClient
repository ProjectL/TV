###How does do content appear on the TV?

There exist a communications tunnel inside the client, that tunnel is provided for via PubNub's Android Library.

Pubnub allows the creation of secure communication channels that can send and receive payloads of data up to 50kb.

So within the client there's the pubnub lib that has a subscribe key and a publish key, the library's code uses pubnub's servers
as a gateway between distributed parts of the Project L.

On the server side, lies the pubnub python/go library. When a request to play an image, video, or audio is sent from a interface such
as a web app or a mobile app, that requests goes thru the motions and eventually hits the service side pubnub code.

As you see here below, the code is pretty simplex.

```#python
def pub(url):
        channel = channel
        message = {
                       "action": "tv.loqoo.v4.ORIGINAL_VIDEO_SCENE",
                       "url": url,                                                                                                                                      
                       "body": "body",
                       "profileNAME": "test",
                       "sceneTITLE": "test",
                       "sceneVIEWS": "test",
                       "sceneLIKES": "test",
                       "sceneDURATION": "test",
                       "scenePROVIDER": "youtubeScene"
                  }

```
In the code a pubnub channel is specified along with an action, a msgbody and meta data pertaining to the content being shared.
The channel 
Each TV is a part of a Locale, a Locale is given a text-only phone #. That number allows our users a quick and easy way to
broadcast content and comments to the TV easily from any app on thier phone via SMS.

On the client side code alot more is going on.

This JSON is being pushed from the python lib to the android lib, once the object reaches the client side
its unpacked, moved into the right variables and then played through a media player instance or displayed
as an ImageView.
Heres
But this is usually the last and final step of the process of publishing and broadcasting to the TV.
